The bunker door groans open for the first time in years. M.M. emerges into the perpetual dusk of a world he no longer recognizes. Above, a crescent moon hangs motionless beneath a burning pentagram that splits the sky - both frozen in time since the Black Bomb changed everything.

His motorcycle stands ready, its chrome untarnished despite the years underground. He doesn't remember preparing it, but he knows it's meant for him. The engine starts with a sound like a distant scream.

Through the swirling sand, two monuments pierce the horizon: a pyramid of black stone that seems to absorb light, and the massive corpse of a dragon, its iridescent scales still shifting colors in death. M.M. feels drawn to both, yet understanding neither. The desert between here and there is vast, empty.

The first ride is interrupted by gunfire. A figure on horseback emerges from the heat waves - a Jackal, its face obscured by cascading streams of green matrix code that forms a digital skull. The same code that flickers at the edges of M.M.'s own vision.

"BROTHER," the Jackal's voice crackles like corrupted data. "THE 6 WILL CARRY YOU TO HELL."

Before M.M. can process these words, an armored helicopter materializes upon the horizon. The 6 Dragon Team, their armor marked with an ouroboros - a dragon forever consuming itself. The number 6 on their insignias seems to shift direction, pointing sometimes up, sometimes down.

Weapon raised, a 6 Dragon Member calls out from the helicopter,  "There is only Peace Corps Illumined now."

The Jackal's horse rears. "YOU WILL PAY THE PRICE OF IMMORTALITY."

A firefight erupts. M.M. finds himself diving instinctively behind his motorcycle, his body remembering combat training his mind cannot recall. Through his matrix vision, he sees the bullets leave trails of binary code in the air.

The Jackal vanishes into the desert, but the 6 Dragon Team remains. They lower their weapons.

"Who are you?"

They escort M.M. to a hidden facility beneath the dragon corpse. Scientists in hazmat suits study its decomposition, but through his matrix vision, M.M. sees what they're really studying: time itself, flowing backward through the dragon's veins.

In the deepest chamber, he meets the King - a figure both young and ancient simultaneously, as if two versions of the same man are trying to occupy the same space. Through the matrix code, M.M. sees them flicker between positions: one on the throne, one hooked to life support machines.

"You've come. M.M." both versions speak in unison and as if talking to an old friend. 

The King's younger self holds up a ceremonial chalice. The older self's monitors flash warnings in code only M.M. can read:

DRINK THE BLOOD,
FOR THE GREAT FLOOD
<3

A blue butterfly lands on the chalice's rim.

The desert wind carries the sound of horses. The Jackals are coming. And they're singing an old world hymn about the end of time.
