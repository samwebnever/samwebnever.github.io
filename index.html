        smoke mugwart, its a herb that gives you a feeling of being in a dream.
        waking life isnt too different from a dream. that in a dream feeling is like heroin to me.
        soft non existence. walking around a strange hallucination. feels like boards of canada - telepath.

        it was night, i was in a dark deserted futuristic township. I walked to the far edge of the town and
        there was a small tower. It was shaped like a couple capsules lifted off the ground like a water tower.
        and next to it was a huge laser looking thing spinning around. in the night, the lights from this capsule
        were so beautiful. just, windows in the capsule lit up. the presence of someone else in the dark?
        i went in and there was this really cool chill ADHD stoner dude totally schitzd out on finding alien activity
        anomalies in electromagnetic fields. he was cool to hang out with in that tiny capsule and we probably smoked
        a joint and hotboxd it.

        some other stuff happened i forgot, but eventually there was a really emotional part like 2 people confessing
        their desperate feelings for a broken relationship. it was deeply personal to them, then drake just kinda showed
        up and got emotional about himself and the empire he built and he doesnt know where he's gonna go from here except
        take over the world. Drake world order.

        december 2020 i was on a roadtrip with my family up north to a small coastal town
        to hang out with my grandparents. the entire time i was barely conscious as i fell down
        into the world of DNSCrypt or Ghost Crypt or whatever. ghost crypt is based on these visions
        of a future tech underwater skyscraper haunted by deathly shadow figures that would ominously
        walk halls and just be an unknown strange presence to a lone woman who just came out of
        cryogenesis to search the ocean with aquatic drones for the tear of the moon
        (which falls when a powerful demon is incarnated) because it could be used to obtain
        god like psychic powers which she needed because there was a mass genocide of most earthlings
        from a megacorp, the same megacorp that built the crypt this woman resides in. they task her
        to be eden with corpo commandments or something. and she has to reincarnate the old leaders.
        but meanwhile not everyone on earth actually died and theres a dude with a hoverboard who you'll
        play as in the game. and some shaman treehouse city and a brutalist high corpo city man 
        theres a lot and I dont really know too much either.
