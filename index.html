        <p>whats it all about</p>
        <p>
        december 2020 i was on a roadtrip with my family up north to a small coastal town
        to hang out with my grandparents. the entire time i was barely conscious as i fell down
        into the world of DNSCrypt or Ghost Crypt or whatever. ghost crypt is based on these visions
        of a future tech underwater skyscraper haunted by deathly shadow figures that would ominously
        walk halls and just be an unknown strange presence to a lone woman who just came out of
        cryogenesis to search the ocean with aquatic drones for the tear of the moon
        (which falls when a powerful demon is incarnated) because it could be used to obtain
        god like psychic powers which she needed because there was a mass genocide of most earthlings
        from a megacorp, the same megacorp that built the crypt this woman resides in. they task her
        to be eden with corpo commandments or something. and she has to reincarnate the old leaders.
        but meanwhile not everyone on earth actually died and theres a dude with a hoverboard who you'll
        play as in the game. and some shaman treehouse city and a brutalist high corpo city man 
        theres a lot and I dont really know too much either.

        <p>im rusty on the dev but i know i can do it.</p>
