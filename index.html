        <p>a bit</p><br>
        <p>i was welcomed upon arrival which was slightly against my expectations. i thought id end up totally lost in hyperspace
          i didnt have many hexagonal type geometric visuals, everything was very round and soft. energy bubble cartoon.
          they welcomed me... and showed me something... i dont even know where to begin. (tool lyrics). they welcomed me into a
          space which was like a bar, lots of people in there and i came from one of their insides. after they welcomed me it was kinda like
          okay, theres something you should see. but there were many different entities discussing whether or not they should show me it, not sure if i was ready yet.
          in that time i was just listening and observing, at some moment i said 'im ready!' but they immediately could see
          some sarcasm in that. told me to just be quiet for a bit. a female energy kind of saying like im in a bruised state, maybe a
          bit confused and disorientated from the psychedelics. i saw my elder guardian, seemed like a future self.. old wise self.. said in due time.
          the whole time i felt like a kid, and i am a kid totally im 18 years old. but i have a genuine enthusiasm to exploring
          myself, life, shamanism. just a little young i suppose. so after that it was like aight i guess ill just hang out for a bit instead.
          went down to a few jelly blob like green antenna eyed aliens playing poker and it was a chill space to think.
          i got a bit caught up on the amazement of the whole thing, which is only fair it is quite amazing.
          my memory kind of fades out here but there were some personal realisations, dont be so hard on myself. lots lost to conscious memory
          but buried within me somewhere definitely. i did it a second time but really dont remember too much besides for one moment going to 'hell',
          which wasnt so bad it was a low dose. it just felt a bit bad vibes and the visuals were menacing, red and grey and metallic, thorny.
          and finally, the spirit world said, THEYRE ALWAYS HERE. always there, watching, with us, and happily too.

        <p>draconian thoughtforms will suck blood out of u.</p>
        <p>i cultivate an aesthetic, the WEBNEVER thing. a draconian thoughtform is the most WEBNEVER thing ever.</p>
        <p>I didnt choose those words either, these words were ... are... there..... by LSD spirit.</p>
        <p>we got a huge trash problem init. loads of trash. no where to put it. sinks. gargoyles. rabbit holes.</p>
        <p>compartmentalizing trash. i dont suppose to know what most of it means. i guess i have a little clue but
          GAIA said this is time old tradition.. age old... battle once fought again... 
          literal trash and mind trash. LSD said, as within so without or whatever topsy turny . 
        </p>
        <p>we live in side a vive hive. vibe hive mind. lingering sense of resposibility. vulnerability.
          open up to the possibilities.

        <p>idk i feel strange abt such peculair vibes. theres something about the haunting. deathly. gallow. Its scorpio idk.</p>
        <p>like these vibes are part of this incarnation,, and i want to see them in a really positive light the love and light of the source of course</p>
        <p>and thats kind of the way i mean, celebration of the dark.</p>

        <h5>27/07/21 #0008</h5>
        <p>
          my mom knocked on my door to wake me for school as i had just awoken from seemingly constant dreaming (6:30 am 2 btw).
          i had 3 mugwort spliffs yesterday, mugwort used for potentiating dream clarity. too much to remember or talk about,
          but very beautiful moments. just before i left dreaming i was helping some kids move bricks in low class canada,
          they had a hot tub made of a milk crate and were playing blackjack. i walked into that place with my friend recounting an earlier
          part of my dream, where i was laying in bed with a beautiful girl i know, and she put our faces together like an alex grey
          painting because 'we are trippers so it's okay' (i was susd on the intimacy).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>great sun shines upon us, praise the lord. life is good. im gonna pick up some LSD tomorrow, i plan to visit lizardland.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Star light, star bright,<br>
        First star I see tonight,<br>
        I wish I may, I wish I might,<br>
        Have this wish I wish tonight.<br>

        <h1>WHAT'S REAL</h1>
        <h5>25/07/21 #0007</h5>
        <p>
          if i took the window off i could reach out and touch the tree that grew when we moved in. the wind is strong and
          might blow the tree inside my room.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          everything is real or nothing is real. its either one of those, or both. it is both. what's real? what does real mean?
          real means it exists. most people would define real as existing in the material plane. just because something doesnt
          exist in the material plane doesnt mean it isnt real. is bigfoot real? very real to who has seen bigfoot. not very real
          to who hasnt. and even if bigfoot doesnt exist in the material plane, bigfoot exists within all of us. and maybe thats
          the moral at the end of the story. the real bigfoot, was the friends we made along the way.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          we live in a world. what u think that world is or isnt doesnt change it. what u wish the world to be
          and how u embody that ideal world is what changes the world.

          the magical feeling of a neo dark cottagecore apartment design, the building built like mild escher. the feeling of
          staying at ur grandparents house as a kid and they had wind chimes and cool vases and stained glass.

        <h5>23/07/21 #0005</h5>
        <p>
          school excursion some time in the near future. went to a cool resort with the cohort.
          there was a competition for working out or exercising or something measured by how much
          weight you put on, i came 3rd and put on 0.2kg. people laughed at me, i got pressed abt it.
          threw an apple at them and went to lay on a hill in the shade of a tree listening to a
          beautiful dream album i just found i think it was like soul, about god.
          my friend and i left for the city he made an obscure reference to a future dream poster
          which i didnt understand until i saw it in the world. he gifted me a switch which was dope.
          i was also at sometime playing habbo, hanging out with an admin their username was a seamless cross between
          dog and mystic but the rational realm doesnt allow for that. 
          we had to get back to the resort to get on a train to the airport to go home,
          but we couldnt find anyone when we got there. we were lurking around the resort which had
          now turned into an empty desolate office building, picking up phones trying to contact people.
          the people on the end of the line were mostly like military-esque robots. when we got in contact
          with people the phones lit up green and they sounded distressed, thinking we were terrorists.
          they mustve called a flying super hero duo who came in and blew us up and flew us into the sun.
          then i was watching in 3rd person as they realised we were just tourists. the dream spent the
          next 15 minutes trying to find out how we would land correctly after falling back to earth from
          the sun. we were going through a myriad of solutions when finally we just landed on soft cushions
          people were holding at a festival. oh and then i got a 3rd person glimpse of the girls bedroom
          in the resort. it looked like a hollywood movie they were all milfs like 40 years old and passing
          around sharing a vibrator. idk man. AND THE VIBRATOR HAD A MODE WHERE IT WOULD SPEAK FAMOUS QUOTES
          IN VIBRATION.

          this morning for the first time in all the years a bird perched on the wireframe on my window, as soon as
          i got out of bed. i didnt unscrew my window. maybe i should have. it would be fun to have birds fly in my room.

        <p>
          I was in an underground bunker high school, and our friend groups were split up into political ideologies.
          I was hanging out with the apathetic doomers, we were playing airblade on ps2. i was so fucking good at airblade.
          Hella cozy bean bags, total goth. not just an aesthetic goth, relatively these ppl looked pretty chill compared
          to tiktok goth tryhards. but it was real goth, to the soul. there was a cute girl we were fucking with each other,
          she rested her head in my lap while we played airblade. think she had blue hair. in a good way. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          i met someone who i had a really bad relationship with IRL but it was chill like. a lesson on forgiveness.
          I forgive them even tho they did some fucked shit. but whatever. cant hold on to it forever. we jumped on a bus
          trying to get to the train station and it went the wrong way to a whole nother city. then was in some liminal space
          fast food restaurant. there was a car wash connected to it. car wash and fast food dope. ive been needing to make
          money recently coz i wanna travel. and today after this dream my brother just said there was an opening at burger king.
          fuckkkkkkkkkkk. kinda sux but like gotta do what u gotta do. im just a kid with no qualifications.

          i get scared of the project screen. its such a virgin. so overwhelming where to start carving.
          i already know where to start, like next i should add a hand system... a gun or something.
          or write an outline of what i want this to be like, cause i dont even know yet.
          meanwhile im fixing my brain. deleted instagram, left all my discord servers.
          kinda forces you to come back here. makes u realise, theres like a pervasive haunting loneliness.
          and im just speaking out to the universe, whatever angels hear me. they talk back in the spotify playlist.
          im not connected, anywhere, to anything. its just me and my laptop. trying to actualise my soul.
          im totally cool with being alone and in someway prefer it. i fuck with people but theres not much to do.
          walk around and eat food together.

        <p>
        smoke mugwart, its a herb that gives you a feeling of being in a dream.
        waking life isnt too different from a dream. that in a dream feeling is like heroin to me.
        soft non existence. walking around a strange hallucination. feels like boards of canada - telepath.

        it was night, i was in a dark deserted futuristic township. I walked to the far edge of the town and
        there was a small tower. It was shaped like a couple capsules lifted off the ground like a water tower.
        and next to it was a huge laser looking thing spinning around. in the night, the lights from this capsule
        were so beautiful. just, windows in the capsule lit up. the presence of someone else in the dark?
        i went in and there was this really cool chill ADHD stoner dude totally schitzd out on finding alien activity
        anomalies in electromagnetic fields. he was cool to hang out with in that tiny capsule and we probably smoked
        a joint and hotboxd it.
        </p>

        <p>
        some other stuff happened i forgot, but eventually there was a really emotional part like 2 people confessing
        their desperate feelings for a broken relationship. it was deeply personal to them, then drake just kinda showed
        up and got emotional about himself and the empire he built and he doesnt know where he's gonna go from here except
        take over the world. Drake world order.

        <p>
        december 2020 i was on a roadtrip with my family up north to a small coastal town
        to hang out with my grandparents. the entire time i was barely conscious as i fell down
        into the world of DNSCrypt or Ghost Crypt or whatever. ghost crypt is based on these visions
        of a future tech underwater skyscraper haunted by deathly shadow figures that would ominously
        walk halls and just be an unknown strange presence to a lone woman who just came out of
        cryogenesis to search the ocean with aquatic drones for the tear of the moon
        (which falls when a powerful demon is incarnated) because it could be used to obtain
        god like psychic powers which she needed because there was a mass genocide of most earthlings
        from a megacorp, the same megacorp that built the crypt this woman resides in. they task her
        to be eden with corpo commandments or something. and she has to reincarnate the old leaders.
        but meanwhile not everyone on earth actually died and theres a dude with a hoverboard who you'll
        play as in the game. and some shaman treehouse city and a brutalist high corpo city man 
        theres a lot and I dont really know too much either.
